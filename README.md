**Hey there👋**

I'm Kobe, a cybersecurity student @ Purdue University.

I’m currently learning about network security, digital forensics, penetration testing, and how to break (and fix) things the right way.

I enjoy exploring tools, practicing in labs, and building small security-focused projects as I grow my skills.

This profile is where I’ll share experiments, learning projects, and anything cool I’m working on. Everything here is made from scratch as I continue my journey into cybersecurity.
